***Availability Scheduler***

The Availability Scheduler is a web application designed to help friends or small teams keep track of each other's availability throughout the week. This tool allows users to enter their name and select the time slots they are available during the workdays of Tuesday to Saturday. The primary aim of this scheduler is to simplify the process of finding common free time, eliminating the need for constant phone calls or messages.

**Backstory**

This website was created to assist my university friends(so that's why it ranges from tue to sat our uni working days. You can add more days if you want to) during our busy weekdays. We found ourselves constantly calling or texting each other to ask about free time, which led to the idea of building a simple, easy-to-use availability tracker. The goal was to make our lives a bit easier by providing a centralized platform where we could all check each other's availability without the hassle
